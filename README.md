### Music Engine
The music engine is an application that takes in music, and can output ideas on where to go next. If you play a simple melody, it will suggest ways to extend or vary that melody.

### How to use
You can start by playing a simple melody on piano, recording it as a MIDI file, uploading that to the Engine, and then wait for the Engine to output an extension, or variations on that melody.
